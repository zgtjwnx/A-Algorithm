# A_Algorithm
Using A* Algorithm to compute an optimal path in a discretized map
Designed a discretized map (including four highways and three types of cells: blocked, unblocked, partially
blocked) using JavaFX

Constructed optimal paths using weighted A*, uniform, and other methods between start point and goal
point

Calculated the difference of time expenses, memory costs and relative performances between algorithms in
order to find a best one
